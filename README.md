<h3>(mk-proj-dir)</h3>
<hr/>

A quick Applescript that copies a project directory template into the top most finder window.

The Alfred Extension requires the user to update the script with the file path to their $TEMPLATE-SOURCE and what thei would like the new structures $OUTPUT-NAME to be.

>
> My  $OUTPUT-NAME = "TBD - Project"
