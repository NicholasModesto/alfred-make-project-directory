Make Project Directory
=======================

A quick Applescript that copies a project directory template into the top most finder window.

The Alfred Extension requires the user to update the script with the file path to their $TEMPLATE-SOURCE and what thei would like the new structures $OUTPUT-NAME to be.

*For Example:*
> My $TEMPLATE-SOURCE = "~/ActiveProjects/_JobNumber - Project Template"
>
> My  $OUTPUT-NAME = "TBD - Project"
